# Dataset-Improvement-Using-Outlier-Removal

Dataset Improvement Using Outlier Removal is a Python-based project aimed at enhancing data quality by removing statistical outliers. The project uses two key algorithms‚ÄîIsolation Forest and Elliptic Envelope‚Äîto detect and eliminate anomalies from datasets. A regression model is used to evaluate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) before and after outlier removal. The graphical user interface is built with PyQt Designer, with automated code generation via PyUIC. The tool takes a housing dataset as input and outputs MAE values and dataset shapes before and after processing. It emphasizes accuracy improvement in data analysis. Scikit-learn is used for model implementation. Results demonstrate a noticeable reduction in MAE. The project is modular and scalable for application in other domains.

## üìä Dataset Used
**Housing Dataset**
- The dataset contains features related to real estate or housing (though exact column names are not specified in the doc).
